# My Blog react app

I built this project in order to learn and practice React apps by following online tutorial and adding new functionality instead of the deprecated hooks and functions in React version 6, i.e. 
- *useHistory* >> *useNavigate*,
- *useSwitch* >> *Routes*.

## Creating App

*npx*

```
npx create-react-app my-app
```

I used json server for the database purpose.
I created local json server by running 
```
npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000
```
## to start the app 
``` 
npm satrt
```
